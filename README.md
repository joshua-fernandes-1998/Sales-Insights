Hello Users, this is my data analytics project on the company's revenue dataset pertaining to the trasactions, products, market, dates, and customers in the SQL database. 
Based on it, I'v created an interactive dashboard with the help of Tableau to understand the trends observed from the data. 
It inclused data mining techniques of a star schema table which correlates the fact table to the dimension tables.
With the display of the total revenue accumulated and quanity of products sold based on the location of the markets over the year span, we've created 
meaningful insights for the company director to understand how the sales have been affected over the years.
This could help the company to improve on the regions which they should focus on, prioritise the quantity of products in higher demand regions,
analyse the trends in the data and plan for further scope of which products they should continue selling.
